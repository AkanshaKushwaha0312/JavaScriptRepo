var x = 1;
function foo() {
  x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
foo();
console.log(x);

Output1 :: 2
Output2 :: 2

Explaination :: var x = 1 is declared globally but, inside function foo, the value of x which was 1 is overridden with 2.
                So, both the times we are printing 'x', the outcome is 2.
